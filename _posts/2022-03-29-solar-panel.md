## Abstract

The solar panel tracking project began from an effort to combine my passions for the environment and for embedded systems. This project is still in progress, but has served to teach me in electrical wiring, C++ firmware, voltage measuring, and microcontroller basics.

## Intro
This is a basic solar panel kit from Brown Dog Gadgets. I chose this kit because this was my first time building a solar panel tracker, and I did not want to buy all the materials separately (especially given the time it takes for chips to be shipped these days). This kit comes with an online tutorial and open source code to get you started.

### Materials
This project requires:
- wire cutters
- wire strippers
- small screwdriver (flathead and Phillips)
- 3 triple A batteries

It's nice to have:
- antistatic mat
- pliers
